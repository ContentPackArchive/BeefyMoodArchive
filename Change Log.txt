Known issues:
-Likely issues with volume and looping for music in areas I don't frequent (Law + Boss HQ stuff, for example)
-Some cog attacks and gags may not be fully textured. (i.e. colored on gag screen but not in battle)
-Party music has not been checked.
-The opposite side of the CFO door is messed up for some reason. I can't find the texture that's supposedly on it.
-Lawbot HQ and Bossbot HQ are untouched texture-wise and will have their textures from Happy Days. As I have not worked my toons through these HQs yet, I don't know what I should change.

Once Toontown Offline gets a Windows 7 bug fix, I will be able to test everything and change things in these areas.
