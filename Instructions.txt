Hiya! Thanks for downloading my content pack! Getting this pack to work with Toontown Rewritten is super easy. Just follow these steps:


WINDOWS

1) Go into your computer's program files
2) Find the folder called "Toontown Rewritten" (EX: Computer > C: Drive > Program Files (x86) > Toontown Rewritten)
3) Drag the entire "resources" folder included with the pack and put it in the Toontown Rewritten folder. If you already have a resources folder, simply overwrite it with these new files
4) Load TTR and enjoy! The game will load the files in the resources folder instead of the normal files, giving you custom music and textures!


MAC

1) Open Finder.
2) On the menu, click "Go" then select "Go to Folder"
3) Type or paste this in: ~/Library/Application Support/
4) Find the TTR folder
5) Drag in the "resources" folder into the TTR folder
6) Load TTR


If you ever want to remove the textures, simply remove the resources folder.

If you're running a different version of Toontown, simply find the resources folder for that game. Some versions even allow you to load a content pack from the menu.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me!
