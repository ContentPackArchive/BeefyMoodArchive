Q: Who are all these characters I'm seeing everywhere?

A: They're characters from a novel I wrote! Basically they're a big part of me so I always try to mark things I make with them. The guy in orange with glasses is Nathan (aka my novel equivalent), you'll see him the most since he resembles me. FlamDawg appears on the Neptune statue, he's an energetic electronics-obsessed dog. There's also Alex, a werewolf and Nathan's best friend. You'll see a lot of them together. Then there's Zack Hakton, a video game hacker who can somehow hack real life and cause virtually anything to happen. He is seen literally everywhere in the novel, often times with his face on paintings or other things, which is why you'll see his face plastered everywhere in TTR. Finally we have Sarah and Amber, the sassy queen of darkness and the peppy fashionista respectively. They'll all be seen here and there. I also used them to mark the different playgrounds.


Q: What's with all the chickens?

A: I have pet chickens! Cute lil poofs. We originally got 12 back in 2014 and 9 more in early 2017. While I do try to include photos of them as well as chicken-related things, you'll mostly see Chick Norris everywhere. Chick is a buff orpington who lives in the house and acts very much like a cat. She's a spoiled princess who will sit in your lap and purr. She can't sleep without her special blanket. There's also Speckles, who can be seen in an estate painting. She's one of the newer chickens and that photo was taken when she was still little.

Q: Do you really have a YouTube channel?

A: Yes! That poster in the HQ (as well as on the Presentation gag) is not fake! My friend and I do videos whenever she visits my house. They're really long and can sometimes be a bit much, but they're always fun and we enjoy doing them. If you're interested in checking it out, search "Natattack" on YouTube.
